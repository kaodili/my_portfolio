                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>The American Heart Association published the first Scientific Statement on Acute
                            Myocardial
                            Infarction in Women. They discovered that:
                        <ul class="">
                            <li>Cardiovascular disease is the #1 leading cause of death for women in the United
                                States
                            </li>
                            <li>Women have "atypical" symptoms more often than men and are 7 times more likely to be
                                misdiagnosed than men</li>
                            <li>High risk abnormalities in ECGs are missed by physicians in Emergency Medicine</li>

                        </ul>
                        In “When Doctors Don’t Listen”, Dr. Kosowsky asserts that active patient involvement
                        can help prevent life-threatening errors.
                        HERA is an application designed to empower women to confidently address their heart health
                        concerns and fight gender inequality in healthcare.

                        <p style="font-style: italic;"> How can we design a product that will effectively reduce the
                            likelihood of misdiagnosing heart disease in women</p>

                            <p> The accuracy of a physician's diagnosis improves with their experience in reading
                                ECG
                                signals. Artificial Intelligence offers a solution to the problem of misdiagnosis,
                                particularly
                                when equipped with a substantial dataset of ECG signals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Hera is a web-based product that leverages deep learning to predict the likelihood
                                of a
                                patient having heart disease based on their ECG results.
                                Users can upload a photo of their ECG results via our web or mobile application, and
                                our system meticulously
                                analyzes these results using a deep learning model to estimate the probability of
                                heart-related issues.

                        <h5 class="pt-4">The Backend</h5>
                        <p>The deep learning model is constructed using a Python-based CNN algorithm, comprising
                            four
                            convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. To initiate the model training
                            process,
                            we ensure that the input data adheres to the required format.
                            We obtained the ECG dataset from the PhysioNet website and performed preprocessing to
                            render
                            it compatible with the CNN in the Keras library.
                            <br>Following this, we partitioned the dataset into separate sets for training and
                            testing,
                            enabling us to evaluate accuracy.
                            In the case of the Android app, we utilized Xamarin and Firebase for development, while
                            the
                            web application was created using a CherryPy server.

                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>HERA takes its name from the Greek goddess of women's health</p>
                        <h5>Initial Questions</h5>
                        <p>Collecting user data was just as important as dislaying results. Questions like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are you experiencing any chest pains? If yes, for how long?</li>
                            <li>Have you been feeling light-headed?</li>
                            <li>Are you experiencing unusual fatigue?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>were important in determing how the patient might be feeling.</p>
                        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="/src/assets/crazy6.png" alt="crazy 6 design of features" />
                        </div>
                        <h5 class="pt-5">User Interface</h5>
                        <p>It was very important that we kept the interface very simple since most of our users
                            would be
                            well in their late 30s
                            and older. With the project duration being short, I couldn't go over multiple iterations
                            as
                            there were other parts of the project to get to.
                            The product sport a user-friendly, straightforward user interface and include an image
                            uploading feature.
                            Our strategy involves storing these images on the server, with the intention of
                            leveraging
                            the collected data to enhance our model.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Due to the time constraint, we were unable to implement the functionality of displaying
                            prompts to the
                            patients. The final interface ended up being a page to upload your ECG result image.
