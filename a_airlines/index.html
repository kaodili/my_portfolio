                <p>I started off by conducting a heuristic evaluation of the mobile application using <a

                        Nielsen's Ten Usability Heuristics</a> to get an understanding of the overall
                    usability. Following my evaluation, I decided to prioritize solving the following issues as they
                    were the most severe for users during this process, and
                    considering the limited time constraint I was working under.

                <p>
                    Overall the process for booking a
                    flight is a
                    multi-step
                    flow, however the system leaves end users without a clear understanding
                    of the number of steps involved. From my research, this leads to frustration and
                    users abandoning process halfway.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Recommendation: </strong> Including a progress bar will tremendously improve
                    this issue.

                            <p>Following my analysis and assesment, I started exploring designs for the
                                progress bar. The progress bar was an important component for this redesign as it
                                was
                                going to be integrated into every page of the mobile app. Because of this, I had
                                multiple iterations
                                of it to make sure it blended seamlessly.

                                Although Option 1 offered a neat design, I chose Option 2 for its
                                precision,
                                given the density of existing information on the screen.
                                <br>Interestingly, one of my user feedback comments mentioned
                                that Option 2 resembled an airplane, aligning well with the theme :)

                                green for its association with progress, but it didn't blend effectively.

                            <p>For the overall redesign, I worked through different versions of each screen, considering feedback from users and comparing it to other airline booking systems.
                                During my competitive analysis, I noticed most booking systems have a single page for listing different flight tiers, 
                                making it easy for users to get a quick overview and decide quickly. However, with American Airlines, it takes a few steps to access information about other tiers.
                                Here are some sample iterations of how the design evolved showing new sort button and direction flow of information.</p>

                            <li>I integrated a <strong>progress bar</strong> to give users a visual

                                of their progress, enabling

                            <li>Additionally, I introduced a <strong>horizontal scroll</strong> section that
                                provides a comprehensive overview of prices for the

                            <li>I reduced the size of the 'sort screen' and implemented a <strong>visual

                                cognitive load of searching
                                through my email for the flight credit. Also, as a software engineer, I
                                understand the technical complexities
                                related to price fluctuations. Incorporating a 'save and return to progress'
                                option was not optimal.
                                <br>I concluded with streamlining the solution to include a dedicated
                                <strong>in-app screen </strong>
                                for searching flight credits, which I consider the most optimal approach.

            <ul>
                <li>This project definitely highlighted how much attention I paid to detail. Many times, I found myself
                    fixating on the smallest of
                    details like ensuring the right amount of white spaces, proper font alignment, and immersing myself
                    in the roles of various end users.
                </li>
                <li>I learnt to embrace tradeoffs. <strong>Leveraging my technical skills</strong>, I was able to define
                    middle grounds that catered to
                    both a software engineer's perspective and a designer's vision.
                    perspective, as well as a designer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Always start with sketches and lofi diagrams. </strong>Starting with this approach
                    is
                    crucial because creating hi-fi prototypes can be complex,
                    and it's more efficient to explore creativity through sketches first. This way, I can avoid
                    investing too much time in high-fidelity work that might require significant revisions
                </li>
                <li>For the redesign, I had another idea to implement <strong>an infinity progress bar extending beyond
                        a single screen.</strong> This will be
                    optimal
                    for a flow where all the steps exceed the width of the mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Also, substituting words in the progress bar with icons will enhance cleanliness and compactness.
                </li>
